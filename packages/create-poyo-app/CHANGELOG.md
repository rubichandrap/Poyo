## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- Scaffolds a new Poyo project from the template package with `create-poyo-app <name>` (positional or `--project`)
- Copies the template skeleton wholesale, renames `Poyo` to the project name across files, and rewrites `package.json` with a fresh version and `@rubichandrap/poyo` pinned to the current release
- Runs `pnpm install` in the generated project, or skips it with `--skip-install`
- Resolves the template from the local workspace during monorepo development and from the registry when published

### Changed

- Rewritten in TypeScript as a standalone package; the template comes from `@rubichandrap/poyo-template` instead of copying the whole repo

### Removed

- The old whole-repo-copy `cli/create-poyo-app.js` scaffolder
